1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] defines a collection of signature
   algorithms, referred to as Composite ML-DSA, which combine ML-DSA
   [FIPS204] with traditional algorithms RSASSA-PKCS1-v1.5, RSASSA-PSS,
   ECDSA, Ed25519, and Ed448.  This document acts as a companion to
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] by providing conventions for using
   Composite ML-DSA algorithms within the Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS) [RFC5652].

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   This document is consistent with the terminology defined in
   [RFC9794].

2.  Composite ML-DSA Algorithm Identifiers

   Many ASN.1 data structure types use the AlgorithmIdentifier type to
   identify cryptographic algorithms.  In the CMS, AlgorithmIdentifiers
   are used to identify Composite ML-DSA signatures in the signed-data
   content type.  They may also appear in X.509 certificates used to
   verify those signatures.  The same AlgorithmIdentifiers are used to
   identify Composite ML-DSA public keys and signature algorithms.
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] describes the use of Composite ML-
   DSA in X.509 certificates.  The AlgorithmIdentifier type is defined
   as follows:

   AlgorithmIdentifier{ALGORITHM-TYPE, ALGORITHM-TYPE:AlgorithmSet} ::=
           SEQUENCE {
               algorithm   ALGORITHM-TYPE.&id({AlgorithmSet}),
               parameters  ALGORITHM-TYPE.
                      &Params({AlgorithmSet}{@algorithm}) OPTIONAL
           }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5911] and is compatible with
      |  the 2021 ASN.1 syntax [X680].  See [RFC5280] for the 1988 ASN.1
      |  syntax.

   The fields in the AlgorithmIdentifier type have the following
   meanings:

   algorithm:  The algorithm field contains an OID that identifies the
      cryptographic algorithm in use.  The OIDs for Composite ML-DSA
      algorithms are described below.

   parameters:  The parameters field contains parameter information for
      the algorithm identified by the OID in the algorithm field.  Each
      Composite ML-DSA parameter set is identified by its own algorithm
      OID, so there is no relevant information to include in this field.
      As such, parameters MUST be omitted when encoding a Composite ML-
      DSA AlgorithmIdentifier.

   The object identifiers for Composite ML-DSA algorithms are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs], and are reproduced here for
   convenience.

3.  Signed-Data Conventions

3.1.  Pre-Hashing

   [RFC5652] specifies that digital signatures for CMS are produced
   using a digest of the message to be signed and the signer's private
   key.  At the time RFC 5652 was published, all signature algorithms
   supported in the CMS required a message digest to be calculated
   externally to that algorithm, which would then be supplied to the
   algorithm implementation when calculating and verifying signatures.
   Since then, EdDSA [RFC8032] and ML-DSA [FIPS204] have also been
   standardized, and these algorithms support both a "pure" and "pre-
   hash" mode, although their use in CMS has only been defined for
   "pure" mode.

   Composite ML-DSA operates only in a "pre-hash" mode.  However, unlike
   RSA and ECDSA each Composite ML-DSA algorithm is defined to be used
   with a single digest algorithm which is identified in the Composite
   ML-DSA algorithm name.  For example, id-MLDSA87-ECDSA-P521-SHA512
   uses SHA-512 as its pre-hash digest algorithm.

   When Composite ML-DSA is used in CMS, the digest algorithm used by
   CMS SHALL be the same pre-hash digest algorithm used by the Composite
   ML-DSA algorithm.  A Composite ML-DSA algorithm might use additional
   digest algorithms for the internal component algorithms, these digest
   algorithms are irrelevant to Composite ML-DSA's use in CMS.

3.2.  SignedData digestAlgorithms

   The SignedData digestAlgorithms field includes the identifiers of the
   message digest algorithms used by one or more signer.  There MAY be
   any number of elements in the collection, including zero.  When
   signing with a Composite ML-DSA algorithm, the list of identifiers
   MAY include a digest algorithm from Table 1.  The digest algorithm(s)
   included will depend on the Composite ML-DSA algorithm(s) used for
   signing.  If such a digest algorithm is present, the algorithm
   parameters field MUST be absent.

3.3.  Signature Generation and Verification

   [RFC5652] describes the two methods that are used to calculate and
   verify signatures in the CMS.  One method is used when signed
   attributes are present in the signedAttrs field of the relevant
   SignerInfo, and another is used when signed attributes are absent.
   Use of signed attributes is preferred, but the conventions for
   signed-data without signed attributes is also described below for
   completeness.

   When signed attributes are absent, Composite ML-DSA signatures are
   computed over the content of the signed-data.  As described in
   Section 5.4 of [RFC5652], the "content" of a signed-data is the value
   of the encapContentInfo eContent OCTET STRING.  The tag and length
   octets are not included.

   When signed attributes are included, Composite ML-DSA signatures are
   computed over the complete DER encoding of the SignedAttrs value
   contained in the SignerInfo's signedAttrs field.  As described in
   Section 5.4 of [RFC5652], this encoding includes the tag and length
   octets, but an EXPLICIT SET OF tag is used rather than the IMPLICIT
   [0] tag that appears in the final message.  At a minimum, the
   signedAttrs field MUST include a content-type attribute and a
   message-digest attribute.  The message-digest attribute contains a
   hash of the content of the signed-data, where the content is as
   described for the absent signed attributes case above.  Recalculation
   of the hash value by the recipient is an important step in signature
   verification.

   Composite ML-DSA has a context string input that can be used to
   ensure that different signatures are generated for different
   application contexts.  When using Composite ML-DSA as specified in
   this document, the context string is set to the empty string.

3.4.  SignerInfo Content

   When using Composite ML-DSA, the fields of a SignerInfo are used as
   follows:

   digestAlgorithm:  Per Section 5.3 of [RFC5652], the digestAlgorithm
      field identifies the message digest algorithm used by the signer
      and any associated parameters.  This MUST be the same digest
      algorithm used by the Composite ML-DSA algorithm.  Per [RFC8933],
      if the signedAttrs field is present in the SignerInfo, then the
      same digest algorithm MUST be used to compute both the digest of
      the SignedData encapContentInfo eContent, which is carried in the
      message-digest attribute, and the digest of the DER-encoded
      signedAttrs, which is passed to the signature algorithm.  See
      Table 1 for exact algorithm mappings.

      [RFC5754] defines the use of SHA-256 [FIPS180] (id-sha256) and
      SHA-512 [FIPS180] (id-sha512) in CMS.  [RFC8702] defines the used
      of SHAKE256 [FIPS202] in CMS (id-shake256).  When id-sha256 or id-
      sha512 is used, the parameters field MUST be omitted.  When id-
      shake256 is used the parameters field MUST be omitted and the
      digest length MUST be 64 bytes.

              Table 1: Digest Algorithms for Composite ML-DSA

   signatureAlgorithm:  The signatureAlgorithm field MUST contain one of
      the Composite ML-DSA signature algorithm OIDs, and the parameters
      field MUST be absent.  The algorithm OID MUST be one of the OIDs
      described in Section 2.

   signature:  The signature field contains the signature value
      resulting from the use of the Composite ML-DSA signature algorithm
      identified by the signatureAlgorithm field.  The Composite ML-DSA
      signature-generation operation is specified in Section 4.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs], and the signature-verification
      operation is specified in Section 4.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].  Note that Section 5.6 of
      [RFC5652] places further requirements on the successful
      verification of a signature.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a value from the "SMI Security for PKIX
   Module Identifier" registry for the included ASN.1 module.

   *  Decimal: IANA Assigned - *Replace TBDCompositeMOD*

   *  Description: Composite-Signatures-CMS-2026 - id-mod-composite-
      mldsa-cms-2026

   *  References: This Document

6.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations from [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs]
   apply.

   Security of the Composite ML-DSA private key is critical.  Compromise
   of the private key will enable an adversary to forge arbitrary
   signatures.

   Composite ML-DSA depends on high-quality random numbers that are
   suitable for use in cryptography.  The use of inadequate pseudo-
   random number generators (PRNGs) to generate such values can
   significantly undermine the security properties offered by a
   cryptographic algorithm.  For instance, an attacker may find it much
   easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced any private
   keys, searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than
   brute-force searching the whole key space.  The generation of random
   numbers of a sufficient level of quality for use in cryptography is
   difficult; see Section 3.6.1 of [FIPS204] for some additional
   information.

   To avoid algorithm substitution attacks, the CMSAlgorithmProtection
   attribute defined in [RFC6211] SHOULD be included in signed
   attributes.

Appendix A.  Examples

   This appendix contains an example signed-data encoding with the id-
   MLDSA65-ECDSA-P256-SHA512 signature algorithm.

   It can be verified using the example public keys and certificates
   specified in Appendix E of [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs].
   Specifically, the following example:

   *  tcId: id-MLDSA65-ECDSA-P256-SHA512

   *  x5c: Base64 of the DER encoding of the certificate.  Wrap this in
      PEM headers and footers to get a PEM certificate.

   To keep example size down, the signing certificate is not included in
   the CMS encoding.  The example certificate from
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] used to sign the CMS content is
   self-signed.

   The following is an example of a signed-data with a single id-
   MLDSA65-ECDSA-P256-SHA512 signer, with signed attributes included:
