1.  Introduction

   This document acts as a companion to
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs] by providing conventions for using
   the Composite ML-DSA algorithm within the Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS).

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   This document is consistent with the terminology defined in
   [RFC9794].  In addition, the following terminology is used throughout
   this document:

   *ALGORITHM*: The usage of the term "algorithm" within this document
   generally refers to any function which has a registered Object
   Identifier (OID) for use within an ASN.1 AlgorithmIdentifier.  This
   loosely, but not precisely, aligns with the definitions of
   "cryptographic algorithm" and "cryptographic scheme" given in
   [RFC9794].

   *BER*: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   *CLIENT*: Any software that is making use of a cryptographic key.
   This includes a signer, verifier, encrypter, decrypter.  This is not
   meant to imply any sort of client-server relationship between the
   communicating parties.

   *DER*: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   *PKI*: Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   *PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY*: The public and private portion of an
   asymmetric cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which
   algorithm.

   *SIGNATURE*: A digital cryptographic signature, making no assumptions
   about which algorithm.

2.  Use in CMS

   Composite Signature algorithms MAY be employed for one or more
   recipients in the CMS signed-data content type [RFC5652].

   All recommendations for using Composite ML-DSA in CMS are fully
   aligned with the use of ML-DSA in CMS [RFC9882].

2.1.  Underlying Components

   A compliant implementation MUST support SHA-512 [FIPS.180] for all
   composite variants in this document.  Implementations MAY also
   support other algorithms for the SignerInfo digestAlgorithm and
   SHOULD use algorithms that produce a hash value of a size that is at
   least twice the collision strength of the internal commitment hash
   used by ML-DSA.

   Note: The Hash ML-DSA Composite identifiers are relevant here because
   this algorithm operation mode is not provided in CMS, which is
   consistent with [RFC9882].

   TODO -- DO we need to specify mandatory-to-implement digest
   algorithms, the same way we specify KDF algs for KEMs?

2.2.  SignedData Conventions

   As specified in CMS [RFC5652], the digital signature is produced from
   the message digest and the signer's private key.  The signature is
   computed over different values depending on whether signed attributes
   are absent or present.

   When signed attributes are absent, the composite signature is
   computed over the content of the signed-data.  The "content" of a
   signed-data is the value of the encapContentInfo eContent OCTET
   STRING.  The tag and length octets are not included.  When signed
   attributes are present, a hash is computed over the content using the
   hash function specified in Section 2.1, and then a message-digest
   attribute is constructed to contain the resulting hash value, and
   then the result of DER encoding the set of signed attributes, which
   MUST include a content-type attribute and a message-digest attribute,
   and then the composite signature is computed over the DER-encoded
   output.  In summary:

   IF (signed attributes are absent)
      THEN Composite-ML-DSA.Sign(content)
   ELSE message-digest attribute = Hash(content);
      Composite-ML-DSA.Sign(DER(SignedAttributes))

   When using Composite Signatures, the fields in the SignerInfo are
   used as follows:

   digestAlgorithm: Per Section 5.3 of [RFC5652], the digestAlgorithm
   contains the one-way hash function used by the CMS signer.  To ensure
   collision resistance, the identified message digest algorithm SHOULD
   produce a hash value of a size that is at least twice the collision
   strength of the internal commitment hash used by ML-DSA component
   algorithm of the Composite Signature.

   signatureAlgorithm: The signatureAlgorithm MUST contain one of the
   the Composite Signature algorithm identifiers as specified in
   Section 2.1}

   signature: The signature field contains the signature value resulting
   from the composite signing operation of the specified
   signatureAlgorithm.

2.3.  Signature generation and verification

   Composite signatures have a context string input that can be used to
   ensure that different signatures are generated for different
   application contexts.  When using composite signatures for CMS, the
   context string is the empty string.

2.4.  Certificate Conventions

   The conventions specified in this section augment RFC 5280 [RFC5280].

   The willingness to accept a composite Signature Algorithm MAY be
   signaled by the use of the SMIMECapabilities Attribute as specified
   in Section 2.5.2. of [RFC8551] or the SMIMECapabilities certificate
   extension as specified in [RFC4262].

   The intended application for the public key MAY be indicated in the
   key usage certificate extension as specified in Section 4.2.1.3 of
   [RFC5280].  If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate
   that conveys a composite Signature public key, then the key usage
   extension MUST contain only the following value:

   digitalSignature
   nonRepudiation
   keyCertSign
   cRLSign

   The keyEncipherment and dataEncipherment values MUST NOT be present.
   That is, a public key intended to be employed only with a composite
   signature algorithm MUST NOT also be employed for data encryption.
   This requirement does not carry any particular security
   consideration; only the convention that signature keys be identified
   with 'digitalSignature','nonRepudiation','keyCertSign' or 'cRLSign'
   key usages.

2.5.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute Conventions

   Section 2.5.2 of [RFC8551] defines the SMIMECapabilities attribute to
   announce a partial list of algorithms that an S/MIME implementation
   can support.  When constructing a CMS signed-data content type
   [RFC5652], a compliant implementation MAY include the
   SMIMECapabilities attribute.

   The SMIMECapability SEQUENCE representing a composite signature
   Algorithm MUST include the appropriate object identifier as per
   Section 2.1 in the capabilityID field.

Appendix A.  Implementation Considerations

A.1.  Backwards Compatibility

   TODO - say something meaningful about backwards compatibility within
   the CMS context.

Appendix B.  Test Vectors

   TODO - Fix this once we have test vectors.

   The following test vectors are provided in a format similar to the
   NIST ACVP Known-Answer-Tests (KATs).

   The structure is that a global message m is signed over in all test
   cases. m is the ASCII string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
   dog."  Within each test case there are the following values:

   *  tcId the name of the algorithm.

   *  pk the verification public key.

   *  x5c a self-signed X.509 certificate of the public key.

   *  sk the decapsulation private key.

   *  s the signature value.

   Implementers should be able to perform the following tests using the
   test vectors below:

   1.  Load the public key pk or certificate x5c and use it to verify
       the signature s over the message m.

   2.  Validate the self-signed certificate x5c.

   3.  Load the signing private key sk and use it to produce a new
       signature which can be verified using the provided pk or x5c.

   Test vectors are provided for each underlying component in isolation
   for the purposes of debugging.

   Due to the length of the test vectors, you may prefer to retrieve
   them from GitHub.  The reference implementation that generated them
   is also available:
